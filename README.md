# Evolution Simulation


## Description

In this project, we aim to simulate an ecosystem consisting of diverse procedural organisms like animals and plants. The world is displayed as a grid with different tiles, each representing a unique environment that can affect and be affected by the organisms living within it. The simulation includes advanced features such as organisms' ability to move, eat, reproduce, and mutate their genes. Additionally, we incorporate a neural network to model animal behavior and decision-making, providing a complex and dynamic ecosystem.

## Features
### Dynamic Water System
Tiles simulate water flow, spawn new water sources, and undergo evaporation, impacting organism survival in diverse environmental conditions.

### Growth Dynamics
Each tile's growth value, influenced by water presence and environmental factors, affects food availability for herbivores and the ecosystem's overall health.

### Terrain and Erosion
Varied terrain undergoes erosion based on water flow, shaping landscapes and affecting organism movement and habitat availability.

### Organism Interactions
Organisms interact with the environment and each other through movement, feeding, and reproduction, closely modeled to produce realistic outcomes.

### Neural Network for Behavior Modeling (WiP)
Animal behavior will be simulated using neural networks, enabling complex decision-making that evolves over time as organisms adapt to changing environmental conditions.

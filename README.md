# Evolution Simulation Project

Welcome to the Evolution Simulation project!

Our goal is to simulate the evolution of virtual organisms using neural networks within a dynamic environment. Our main vision is to maintain procedural simulation, avoiding the implementation of predefined animal types. This approach allows evolutionary selection to unfold freely, potentially surprising us with its results.

The goal is to continually make the simulation more complex by adding new features from real life to enable vast amount of different adaptations to the simulations settings.

Below, you'll find information on how to set up and run the simulation, as well as an overview of its features.

## Features

- Animals consuming food and utilizing energy to survive.
- Reproduction based on accumulated energy.
- DNA system defining various aspects of an animal (work in progress).
- Organism Database to filter and query (work in progress)
- Visualization of gene distribution in the simulation (work in progress).
- User-friendly GUI for simulation settings adjustment (work in progress).

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-feature`).
6. Create a new pull request.

## Credits

This project was initiated by Jeremy Moser.

Later on it was worked on as a project for a lecture Programmig for Data Science by Jeremy Moser, Andrin MÃ¼ller, Dimoth Pathiniwasam and Milos Kecman

Inspirations for the project were other projects like [the Bibites](https://www.youtube.com/@TheBibitesDigitalLife), [Coding Train](https://github.com/CodingTrain), [Sebastian Lague](https://github.com/SebLague) and many more.

# Evolution Simulation


## Description

In this project, we aim to simulate an ecosystem consisting of diverse procedural organisms like animals and plants.
The world is displayed as a grid with different tiles. 
The simulation has several features, including the ability for organisms to move, eat and reproduce. (and mutate their genes doing so)
We will also implement a neural network to model animal behavior and decision making.
